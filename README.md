# SCCG

This is the repository of our implementation of the SCCG algorithm explained in the paper *Shi et al. 2019. High efficiency referential genome compression algorithm*
(DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty934).

This project is part of the [Bioinformatics 1](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/enbio1) course at FER, Universitiy of Zagreb. 

Done by [Martin Bakač](mbakac.from.hr) and Marta Bonacin under the supervision of [izv. prof. dr. sc. Mirjana Domazet-Lošo](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/mirjana.domazet-loso).

## Idea

The main idea proposed by the paper is to exploit the inherent properties of genetic data in order to develop a compression algorithm with better compression ratios and a faster runtime.

## Running the program

```
# gruba skica samo radi markdowna
sh ./run -i <input_data> -o <output_file>
```
